    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make each pull request as small and simple as possible\n",
    "- Commit messages should be clear and describe the changes\n",
    "- Larger changes should be broken down into their basic components and integrated separately\n",
    "- Bug fixes should be their own pull requests with an associated [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/icesat2-cookbook/issues) using the Bug Report template.\n",
    "- Write a descriptive pull request message with a clear title\n",
    "- Please be patient as reviews of pull requests take time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Contribute\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account by clicking the \"Fork\" button on the project [main page](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/icesat2-cookbook/issues). This creates your own server-side copy of the repository.\n",
    "2. Either by cloning to your local system or working on a hosted JupyterHub (such as [CryoCloud](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com/)), create a work environment to make your changes using either `conda` or `pixi`.\n",
    "3. Add your fork as the `origin` remote and the original project repository as the `upstream` remote. While this step isn't a necessary, it allows you to keep your fork up to date in the future.\n",
    "4. Create a new branch to do your work.\n",
    "5. Make your changes on the new branch.\n",
    "6. Push your work to GitHub under your fork of the project.\n",
    "7. Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/icesat2-cookbook/pulls) from your forked branch to the project repository."
